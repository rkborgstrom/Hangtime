# Q2-Project Description

For my Q2 project, I am creating an application to allow users to input data from their day on the mountain. This application will attract people who enjoy snowboarding or skiing in any location. I will include an account login page to allow users to keep a log of their data and past trips. I will also allow users to create, read, update, and delete data. 

Technologies used: 
  HTML
  CSS
    Bootstrap
  EJS
  Express Server
  Knex
  Postgres Database
 
 As a user, I need to be able to identify the company (logo/branding)
 As a user, I need to be able to create an account
 As a user, I need to be able to login to my account
 As a user, I need to be able to post a picture
 As a user, I need to be able to log information about the mountain
 As a user, I need to be able to create, read, update, and delete data
 As a user, I need to be able to keep a log of my past data
 As a user, I need to be able to view other user logs
 As a user, I need to be able to search the weather at the top of the page
 As a user, I need to be able to create a secure password
 
 A stretch goal for this project is to include a redone version of the weather API I used in my Q1 project.
