 # Q2-Project Description:
For my Q2 project, I am creating an application to allow users to input data from their day on the mountain. This application will attract people who enjoy snowboarding or skiing in any location. I will include an account login page to allow users to keep a log of their data and past trips. I will also allow users to create, read, update, and delete data.
